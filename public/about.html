		<h2>Six Interesting Findings</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Capital River has the most crimes and is one of the smallest neighborhoods in Saint Paul</li>
			<li>When you search for Como neighborhood, there is one in Minneapolis and one in Saint Paul</li>
			<li>The most popular crimes in the St.Thomas neighborhood of Union Park are property crimes.</li>
			<li>Even though Capitol River has the most crimes it only has around the same amount of violent crimes as any other neighborhood</li>
			<li>The northern part of St.Paul has the most violent crime with Frogtown/North End/Payne/Phalen averaging around 25-35 violent crime where other neighborhoods are around 10-15</li>
			<li>Summit Hill has the least amount of crime with 72, but St.Anthony has the second least crime with 103 but is three times as large as Summit Hill</li>
